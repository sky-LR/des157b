        <h1>Capstone Project Proposal</h1>

        <p>
            My topic for the Centennial Seal project is a “sound map” of the seal that focuses on the sounds that each element of the seal would make. My target audience is people touring Davis, possibly the school, and looking to learn more about the city. I don’t plan on working with a partner since most of my classmates seem interested in other areas like games and educational projects.
            <br><br> 
            I would really like to have a usable mobile UI - I’m imagining that people are going to be accessing my project on-site so I think that’s a must. I’d like to have tap-and-drag interaction to navigate. I’d also like to put the sounds in 3d space somehow, maybe having them shift from left to right as the user scrolls around the seal. 
            <br><br> 
            I think there’s some room in the project for some sort of description of the elements, but I think I’m only going to work on that if the rest of the project turns out to be super easy. I also think I’m going to run into trouble with the mobile UI, I’m pretty out of practice with making things responsive and we haven’t looked at touch events yet so that will be new ground.
