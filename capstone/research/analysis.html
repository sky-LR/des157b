            <h3>

            <p>
                This is a big compilation of different ambient sounds recorded all over the world and musical compositions created around those audio recordings. The user can click and drag around the map, click on their desired location pin, and play the associated audio clips. The user has a lot of control over what sounds are playing and when - there is no autoplay at all as far as I can see. The map is windowed within the framing site which has other information about the project, which unfortunately makes it much easier to leave the main interaction. The UI is also fairly messy - the map has scroll bars along the side that seem to suggest that it’s somehow sized incorrectly, and the contrasty black and orange of the pins creates some very loud visual noise. There’s an overall sense of exploration that can be found when a user is presented with such a large, freely accessible database but there’s something to be desired about the experience here.

            </h3>
            <p>
                This is a much smaller project about birdsongs that focuses on a calmer, more linear experience. There’s not very much in the way of visuals, most of the page is either a green gradient or text. This makes the user focus more on the audio, however, it also makes the site a little more boring to use. Also, there’s no way to navigate through the sections, which means that if you reload the page, you have to go through the whole thing again which could take a few minutes. While it has its restrictions, there is something to be said for the more linear experience as it allows for more design and curation of each moment. One nice thing about the site is that the sounds loop seamlessly and it’s placed in 3d space around the user’s head (probably using Dolby Atmos or a similar program) which allows the user to easily pause and enjoy the atmosphere whenever you choose.
